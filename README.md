This repository demonstrates an uncommon Java error involving dead code that is never reached due to the unconditional exception handling. The code includes a division by zero resulting in an ArithmeticException and a section marked as unreachable due to the try-catch block. The solution shows how to rearrange the logic to prevent the dead code while preserving the error handling and making the code robust and efficient.
